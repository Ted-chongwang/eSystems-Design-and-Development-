      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="paragraphmargin">MongoDB is a high-volume distributed NoSQL database that is able to effectively and efficiently store and process big data. This research paper will explore some MongoDB core principle.

      <h3>I INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p class="paragraphmargin">NoSQL first appeared in 1998 and was developed by Carlo Strozzi as a lightweight, open-source relational database that does not provide SQL functionality [1]. The shortcomings that relational databases cannot overcome were becoming more and more obvious after the rise of the Web 2.0 [2]. With the needs of the NoSQL market, MongoDB was first released in 2009 and has since been updated to the fourth major releases. MongoDB service can be run in the cloud base as MongoDB Atlas that available on AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud platforms or installed in local servers like Ubuntu. MongoDB can be easily operated by using MongoDB statements. However, developers need to understand the working mechanisms to better develop the database.
